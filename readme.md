  This repo is used to run Ubuntu 16.04 on surface pro 4 better. Most feature, including Touchscreen, works. Camera doesn't work.
  
  All the contents come from:

  I only write some shell code to make it easier. 

step1: Install ubuntu16.04 or something on your Surface pro 4

step2: Clone the repo, sudo ./install1.sh, reboot. For most people, that is enough.

step3: If the touchscreen do not work and the graphic performance is bad(I am using a M3 6y30 model and the problem occurs to me), sudo ./install2.sh.
